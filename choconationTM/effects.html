          <h1>Effets of chocolate</h1>
          <button type="button" name="button" class="switch switch-1">Benefits</button>

          <div class="container container-1">The chocolate is energetic, thanks to its composition in sugar and fat: 100 grams of chocolate bring 560 kcal. In comparison, 100 grams of bread provide 250 kcal (on average, a man needs 2,400 kcal per day). <br /> <br />
                Chocolate contains polyphenols, natural molecules responsible for the color of many plants. Polyphenols are antioxidants that trap free radicals, toxic. Thus, they reduce the oxidative stress of cells, responsible for aging and reduce the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Dark chocolate contains 0.80% polyphenols and milk chocolate 0.50%. It can be compared with green tea, which contains 0.30% and with red wine 0.15%. <br/> <br/>
                Dark chocolate contains on average 35% fat, cocoa butter. Thanks to its fatty acid composition, cocoa butter releases more than 70% of oleic acid in the intestine, which contributes to the elimination of cholesterol and the prevention of atherosclerosis. Beware of milk chocolate, which contains animal fats that are good for cholesterol. <br /> <br />

  Methylxanthines are natural molecules found in stimulating plants: coffee, cocoa, tea ... In cocoa, caffeine accounts for only 0.4%. The other cocoa methylxanthine is theobromine, 1.6% present. Caffeine and theobromine are substances of enlightenment, that's why chocolate is a tonic. Theobromine also has bronchodilating properties, it stimulates the central nervous system and improves muscle performance. <br /> <br />
                  Everyone believes that chocolate has antidepressant properties, often associated with the presence of magnesium. This is true, but this virtue also comes from the presence of molecules close to endorphins: phenylethylamine (1.2 mg per 100 g of chocolate) and serotonin (0.8 mg) and furthermore tyramine (1 mg), tryptanime (0.5 mg) and tryptophan, precursor of endorphins. Endorphins are natural substances, secreted by our own body, which possess euphoric and psychostimulating properties. <br /> <br />
                  Chocolate contains magnesium, it is well known, and it is related to its reputation as an antidepressant, associated with the presence of endorphins. But that's not all: chocolate is a primary source of many important trace elements. One hundred grams of chocolate with 70% cocoa cover 20 to 50% of the adult's daily needs for magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, copper and iron. It's enormous. It also contains fluoride that helps prevent cavities.

            Chocolate has other virtues, but in some cases it should be banned. For diabetics it is better to be cautious, even if diabetologists consider that chocolate with more than 70% cocoa presents only a very limited risk. Another condition that excludes chocolate is the tendency to gastro-oesophageal reflux. Cocoa butter promotes relaxation of the upper sphincter of the stomach and leads to gastric reflux in the esophagus. <br /> <br />
                        In cases of hepatic colic, also ingestion of chocolate reinforces the harmful influence of excess sugar and fat. It is also said that chocolate generates allergies. Rather, it is "false food allergy", presumably due to the presence of phenylethylamine and tyramine.
