Men have been eating chocolate for over 5000 years</h1>
      <article class="a">
        <h2>
The Amazonian Indians were already consuming chocolate, in liquid form, 5300 years ago, reveals the analysis of ceramics discovered in Ecuador.</h2>
        <p>When the temperatures start to fall, what's more pleasant than taking refuge with a good fire to enjoy a good hot chocolate? Europeans discovered this pleasure in the sixteenth century only, when the first cocoa beans were brought back to Spain after the first Atlantic crossings. The drink, initially bitter, will be gradually softened with the addition of milk and sugar. But long before helping us overcome the harshness of winter, chocolate in its liquid form was already consumed by people populating the Amazon rainforest 5,300 years ago, in a climate much more lenient. This is the conclusion of work conducted by an international team (Nature Ecology & Evolution) who have just highlighted archaeological evidence showing the consumption of cocoa in South America 1400 years earlier than we had thought until then. br>
        Until now, the oldest traces of chocolate were found in Central America on pottery of 3900 years old. Far from the Amazon. "It had already been identified that cocoa originated in South America and not Central America in previous studies," says Claire Lanaud, geneticist of the Center for International Cooperation in Agronomic Research for Development (CIRAD), co-author of the 'study. "But we did not have archaeological evidence of human use. Discovering such ancient traces is a real surprise. "</p>

        <h2>
A product of everyday life</h2>
        <p>
5300 years ago, cocoa consumption was very different from ours. On the one hand, chocolate only existed in its liquid form and, on the other hand, it had to be drunk cold and without milk. Unfortunately, the analyzes do not reveal the ancient recipe. "We know, however, that people were not content to consume the pulp that surrounds the grain," says Claire Lanaud. "The drinks were made from crushed beans, a highly energetic beverage. And contrary to what one might think, the beans were not very bitter at the time, in this region. The drink was probably pretty sweet. "Once the seeds were crushed, they released nutritious fats, carbohydrates and active ingredients like caffeine. <br> "We found traces of cocoa on more than 30% of the 220 samples of ceramics analyzed. A significant amount that reflects common use, "explains Claire Lanaud. "Both on funeral sites, suggesting that cocoa could be offered as an offering. But also on sites of everyday life. Which shows that cocoa was an everyday drink. This could not be the result of anecdotal picking in the forest! The plants were domesticated. "Objects in the form of cocoa pods have been brought to light, showing the importance of the commodity in society. <br> Seashells, such as spondylus and strombus, from the Pacific coast, were also found in the tombs of the Santa Ana Florida site. Communications existed between the peoples of the Pacific coast and those of Amazonia. "We would like to discover what role cocoa could play in these exchanges," says Claire Lanaud. Assuming he had one, of course.

More than 34,000 tons of chocolate are sold at Christmas in France.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>
The end of year celebrations are a delight for chocolate makers. The season is highly strategic and is getting ready for some at the beginning of August.</h2>
        <p>
It's winter in summer. Industrial chocolatiers started their Christmas production at the beginning of August. The stakes are high: more than 34,000 tons are sold at Christmas in France, or nearly 9% of sales made only over the holiday season, according to the statistics of the trade union of chocolate. In the factories of the Cemoi group, the pace has increased so that the first deliveries are ready by the end of September and seasonal workers have come in as reinforcements. "Our workforce is growing by 100 to 150% in anticipation of this particularly strategic season," says Patrick Poirrier, CEO of the French number one chocolate. For the company with a turnover of 820 million euros, Christmas represents 44% of the volume of its sales. Melting, molding, packaging, the machines will run at full speed until late October and then prepare in December the other highlight of chocolate confectioners: Easter.</p>
        <h2>A season with ever wider contours</h2>
        <p>
"Between consumer surveys, the conceptualization of new trends and customer presentations, a season is preparing two years upstream," says Patrick Poirrier. The goods are then stored in warehouses with temperature control before being delivered in large and medium-sized areas. "This anticipation of the industrialists is at the antipodes of the artisanal production, explains a interlocutor specialized in the transformation of raw material. They must handle a high quality of work in a minimum of time. "Especially chocolate exporters face a season with increasingly large contours. On the other side of the Atlantic, hostilities starting at the end of November with Thanksgiving. <br> The production of artisanal chocolates is done with a tense flow in a few weeks, or even a few days before the start of the holidays. "We work with fragile products that are kept very little, we are told at Maison Fouquet, Parisian chocolatier who cultivates a know-how dating from the nineteenth century. Our chocolates are made the day before to be sold the next day or two days later in the shop. "However, some homes are starting now to anticipate their hiring. The sector is struggling to recruit, particularly because of its high seasonal labor requirements. Chocolatiers, logistics operators, sellers, job offers for these trades abound on the Internet. "We recruit and train staff from September. The goal is to build skills to be fully operational at Christmas, "confirms La Maison du Chocolat which plans to increase its workforce by 30% in its workshops as of the return.
