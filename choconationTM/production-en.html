    <article>
      <p>

        1st step: The harvest of the Cabosse

                      This first step is very delicate, it is necessary that the producer slice the peduncle which connects the pod to the cocoa tree taking care not to damage the floral pad or the bark on which the flowers depend, and therefore the future harvest.

                      <br><br>
                      2nd step: Ecabossage

                      About 3 days after harvest, the producer opens the pods with a knife to manually separate the cocoa beans from the white pulp (placenta or mucilage) of the pod. There are 16 to 60 feves per pod
                      <br><br>
                      3rd step: Fermentation

                      24 hours after the ecocking, this operation aims to stop the process of germination of the feast and thus improve the conservation of the fruits. The beans are stored for a week in large wooden baskets, (containing on average 100kg of beans), each basket will be brewed every 24 hours.
                      <br><br>
                      4th step: Drying

                      In order to stop the fermentation process, the cocoa beans must be dried for 1 to 4 weeks. They are thus arranged on racks or large tarpaulins in full sun on a layer of 1 to 4 cm stirred regularly. To accelerate this stage, industrialists use thermal ovens that heat the beans for 1 to 2 days. Once the beans are dry, they are stored in large sacks and then exported to countries that turn the beans into chocolate.
                      <br><br>
                      5th step: roasting

                      Once the beans are unloaded from the freighter, they are cleaned and then heated for half an hour (from 100 ° to 140 ° C depending on the type of cocoa) in order to develop the aroma of chocolate these flavors mainly depend on the precursors born during fermentation.
                      <br><br>
                      6th step: Hulling

                      Once roasted, the beans are crushed coarsely to separate hulls and sprouts by a ventilation / vibration system (lighter hulls fly away while the heavier bean does not move). Cocoa Bean Composition: Cocoa beans contain about 50% fat called cocoa butter; 3, 5% water; 7% starch; 4% cellulose; 2% of theobromine, 20% of other proteins and 6% of mineral substances
                        <br><br>
                        7th step: Crushing

                        The cocoa seeds then go through different grinding mills according to the desired ripening. They are then transformed into a thick and liquid paste called cocoa mass.
                        <br><br>
                        Step 8: Mixing

                        The cocoa mass is mixed with the other raw materials (sugar and possibly milk) until a homogeneous paste is obtained. The granulometry of the dough is further reduced, using grinding machines, to a size between 20 and 25 μ.
                        <br><br>
                        9th step: The Conchage

                        The dough is subjected to constant and constant agitation, hot, in conches to acquire all its finesse and creaminess.
                        <br><br>
                        Step 10: Tempering

                        Before shaping, the dough must be brought precisely to the temperature that allows a stable crystallization of cocoa butter. This operation leads to a brittle and melting chocolate.
                        <br><br>
                        Step 11: Molding and coating

                        The chocolate can be poured into molds or coated around interiors to be coated.
